    /*Question 9: Variable Naming Conventions

Step 1: Creating a Class and Main Method

    Create a new Java class named NamingConventionsDemo.
    Inside the NamingConventionsDemo class, create a main method.

Step 2: Declaring Variables with Correct Naming Conventions

    Inside the main method, declare an int variable named employeeAge and initialize it with the value 30.
    Declare a String variable named customerName and initialize it with "John Doe".

Step 3: Discussing Invalid Names

    Explain why variable names like 1stVariable, total-amount, and class are invalid in Java.

Step 4: Printing Valid Variables

    Print the values of employeeAge and customerName using System.out.println.

     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int employeeAge = 30;
        String customerName = "John Doe";

        System.out.println(employeeAge+" "+customerName);

       /* Explain why variable names like 1stVariable, total-amount, and class are invalid in Java.
        it is not allowed to start with number
        */
    }
